Modified the api_server.py file of ace to work with this, fixed some bugs in it too and added author and title and some stuff.
Will document more later

Server is up and running at https://xtdevelopment.net/ace

All of these files belong in the top ACE-Step folder fyi. I just put them in here to keep in sorted for everyone. But move these files to top directoy or you will need to make some edits.
